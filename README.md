Each VST folder has all revelant C++ files for each VS based around the iPlug VST SDK.
For example, the KrysarV folder contains all revelant C++ files for Krysar V's source code.

Each VST's documentation can be found at <vstname>.pdf. I.e. krysarv.pdf is Krysar V's documentation location.

To use a VST, download the .dll file and open it within your favorite DAW.
NOTE: Kikimora is a standalone desktop application and cannot be used within a DAW. The purpose of Kikimora is to offer an easy to use step sequenced synthesizer that is great for beginners!

Have fun!
