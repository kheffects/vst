Each Folder has all revelant C++ files for each VST based around the iPlug VST SDK.

In addition, each folder has a readme in PDF format and is named after each folder name. For example, Krysar V's readme can be found at krysarv.pdf within the KrysarV folder.

To use a given VST, simply download the .dll file for each VST. For example, to use Krysar V, download the krysarv.dll file and open it within your favorite DAW.

Have fun!
